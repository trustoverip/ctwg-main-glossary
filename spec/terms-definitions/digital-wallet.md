~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_wallet): A digital wallet, also known as an e-wallet, is an [electronic device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_electronics), [online service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_service_provider), or [software program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) that allows one party to make [electronic transactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_transaction) with another party bartering [digital currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency) units for [goods and services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services). This can include purchasing items either [online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_and_offline) or at the [point of sale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_sale) in a [brick and mortar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_and_mortar) store, using either [mobile payment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_payment) (on a [smartphone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone) or other [mobile device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device)) or (for online buying only) using a [laptop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop) or other [personal computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer). Money can be deposited in the digital wallet prior to any transactions or, in other cases, an individual's bank account can be linked to the digital wallet. Users might also have their [driver's license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driver%27s_license), [health card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Care_Card), loyalty card(s) and other ID documents stored within the wallet. The credentials can be passed to a merchant's terminal wirelessly via [near field communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication) (NFC).

~ Note: In market parlance, a mobile app that performs the [[ref: actions]] of a [[ref: digital agent]] and has access to a set of [[ref: cryptographic keys]] is often simply called a [[ref: wallet]] or a digital wallet.
