[[def: fiduciary, fiduciary, fiduciaries]]

~ A fiduciary is a person who holds a legal or ethical relationship of trust with one or more other [[ref: parties]] (person or group of persons). Typically, a fiduciary prudently takes care of money or other assets for another person. One [[ref: party]], for example, a corporate trust company or the trust department of a bank, acts in a fiduciary capacity to another [[ref: party]], who, for example, has entrusted funds to the fiduciary for safekeeping or investment. In a fiduciary relationship, one person, in a position of vulnerability, justifiably vests confidence, good faith, reliance, and trust in another whose aid, advice, or protection is sought in some matter.
