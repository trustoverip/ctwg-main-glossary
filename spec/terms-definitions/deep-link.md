[[def: deep-link, deep link, deep links, deep linking, deep linked]]

~ In the context of the World Wide Web, deep linking is the use of a hyperlink that links to a specific, generally searchable or indexed, piece of web content on a website (e.g. "https\://example.com/path/page"), rather than the website's home page (e.g., "https\://example.com"). The URL contains all the information needed to point to a particular item. Deep linking is different from [[ref: mobile deep linking]], which refers to directly linking to in-app content using a non-HTTP URI.
