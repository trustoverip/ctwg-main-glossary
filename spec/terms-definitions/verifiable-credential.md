~ [W3C VC](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#terminology): A verifiable credential is a tamper-evident credential that has authorship that can be cryptographically verified. Verifiable credentials can be used to build [verifiable presentations](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-verifiable-presentations), which can also be cryptographically verified. The [claims](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-claims) in a credential can be about different [subjects](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#dfn-subjects).
