[[def: trust-context, trust context, trust contexts]]

~ The context in which a specific [[ref: party]] makes a specific [[ref: trust decision]]. Many different factors may be involved in establishing a trust context, such as: the relevant interaction or [[ref: transaction]]; the presence or absence of existing [[ref: trust relationships]]; the applicability of one or more [[ref: governance frameworks]]; and the location, time, network, and/or devices involved. A trust context may be implicit or explicit; if explicit, it may be identified using an [[ref: identifier]]. A [[ref: ToIP governance framework]] is an example of an explicit trust context identified by a [[ref: verifiable identifier]] (VID).
