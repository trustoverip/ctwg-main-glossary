~ Digital rights management (DRM) is the management of legal access to digital content. Various tools or technological protection measures (TPM) like [[ref: access control]] technologies, can restrict the use of proprietary hardware and copyrighted works. DRM technologies govern the use, modification and distribution of copyrighted works (e.g. software, multimedia content) and of systems that enforce these policies within devices.
