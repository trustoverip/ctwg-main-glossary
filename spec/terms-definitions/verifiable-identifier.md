[[def: verifiable-identifier, verifiable identifier, verifiable identifiers, VID, VIDs]]

~ An [[ref: identifier]] over which the [[ref: controller]] can provide cryptographic [[ref: proof of control]]. Each type of VID defines a specific means for discovering the [[ref: public key]], network [[ref: endpoints]], or other metadata necessary to prove control. [[ref: Decentralized identifiers]] (DIDs) are a W3C standard for VIDs. VIDs are the [[ref: cryptographically verifiable]] identifiers used in the [[ref: ToIP stack]].
