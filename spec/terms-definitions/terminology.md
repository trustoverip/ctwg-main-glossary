[[def: terminology, terminology, terminologies]]

~ Terminology is a group of specialized words and respective meanings in a particular field, and also the study of such [[ref: terms]] and their use; the latter meaning is also known as *terminology science*. A [[ref: term]] is a word, compound word, or multi-word expressions that in specific contexts is given specific meaningsâ€”meaning which may deviate from the meanings the same words have in other contexts and in everyday language. Terminology is a discipline that studies, among other things, the development of such [[ref: terms]] and their interrelationships within a specialized domain. Terminology differs from *lexicography*, as the former involves the study of [[ref: concepts]], conceptual systems and their labels ([[ref: terms]]), whereas lexicography studies words and their meanings.
