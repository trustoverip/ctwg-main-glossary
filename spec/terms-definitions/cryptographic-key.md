[[def: cryptographic-key, cryptographic key, cryptographic keys, cryptographic key pair, cryptographic key pairs]]

~ A key in cryptography is a piece of information, usually a string of numbers or letters that are stored in a file, which, when processed through a cryptographic algorithm, can encode or decode cryptographic [[ref: data]]. Symmetric cryptography refers to the practice of the same [[ref: key]] being used for both [[ref: encryption]] and [[ref: decryption]]. Asymmetric cryptography has separate [[ref: keys]] for [[ref: encrypting]] and [[ref: decrypting]]. These keys are known as the [[ref: public keys]] and [[ref: private keys]], respectively.
