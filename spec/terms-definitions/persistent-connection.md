[[def: persistent-connection, persistent connection, persistent connections]]

~ A [[ref: connection]] that is able to persist across multiple [[ref: communication sessions]]. In a ToIP context, a persistent connection is established when two [[ref: ToIP endpoints]] exchange [[ref: verifiable identifiers]] (VIDs) that they can use to re-establish the [[ref: connection]] with each other whenever it is needed.

~ Contrast with: [[ref: ephemeral connection]].
