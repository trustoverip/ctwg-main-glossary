~ [NIST-CSRC](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/hardware_security_module_hsm): A physical computing device that provides tamper-evident and intrusion-resistant safeguarding and management of digital keys and other secrets, as well as crypto-processing. FIPS 140-2 specifies requirements for HSMs.

~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module): A physical computing device that safeguards and manages secrets (most importantly [digital keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_keys)), performs [encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) and decryption functions for [digital signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature), [strong authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_authentication) and other cryptographic functions. These modules traditionally come in the form of a plug-in card or an external device that attaches directly to a [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer) or [network server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_\(computing\)). A hardware security module contains one or more [secure cryptoprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_cryptoprocessor) [chips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit).
