[[def: legal-person, legal person, legal persons]]

~ In law, a legal person is any person or 'thing' that can do the things a human person is usually able to do in law â€“ such as enter into contracts, sue and be sued, own property, and so on.[<sup>\[3\]\[4\]\[5\]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person#cite_note-3) The reason for the term "legal person" is that some legal persons are not people: companies and corporations are "persons" legally speaking (they can legally do most of the things an ordinary person can do), but they are not people in a literal sense (human beings).
