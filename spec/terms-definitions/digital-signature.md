~ A digital signature is a mathematical scheme that uses cryptography for verifying the authenticity of digital [[ref: messages]] or documents. A valid digital signature, where the prerequisites are satisfied, gives a recipient very high confidence that the [[ref: message]] was created by a known sender ([[ref: authenticity]]), and that the message was not altered in transit ([[ref: integrity]]).
