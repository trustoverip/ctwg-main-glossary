[[def: hourglass-model, hourglass model, hourglass models]]

~ An architectural model for layered systems—and specifically for the [[ref: protocol layers]] in a [[ref: protocol stack]]—in which a diversity of supporting protocols and services at the lower layers are able to support a great diversity of protocols and applications at the higher layers through the use of a single protocol in the [[ref: spanning layer]] in the middle—the “neck” of the hourglass. 

~ See also: [[ref: trust spanning protocol]].

~ Note: The Internet’s [[ref: TCP/IP stack]] follows the hourglass model, and it is the design model for the [[ref: ToIP stack]].
