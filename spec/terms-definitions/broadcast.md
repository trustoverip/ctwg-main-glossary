[[def: broadcast, broadcast]]

~ In computer networking, telecommunication and information theory, broadcasting is a method of transferring a [[ref: message]] to all recipients simultaneously. Broadcast delivers a message to all [[ref: nodes]] in the network using a one-to-all association; a single [[ref: datagram]] (or [[ref: packet]]) from one sender is routed to all of the possibly multiple endpoints associated with the [[ref: broadcast address]]. The network automatically replicates [[ref: datagrams]] as needed to reach all the recipients within the scope of the broadcast, which is generally an entire network subnet.
