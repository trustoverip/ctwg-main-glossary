[[def: key-event, key event, key-event, key events]]

~ An event in the history of the usage of a [[ref: cryptographic key pair]]. There are multiple types of key events. The inception event is when the key pair is first generated. A rotation event is when the key pair is changed to a new key pair. In some [[ref: key management systems]] (such as [[ref: KERI]]), key events are tracked in a [[ref: key event log]].
