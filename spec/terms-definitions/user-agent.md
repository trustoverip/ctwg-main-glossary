~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent): On the [Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web), a user agent is a [software agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_agent) capable of and responsible for retrieving and facilitating [end user](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_user) interaction with Web content.[<sup>\[1\]</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent#cite_note-1) This includes all common [web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser), such as [Google Chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome), [Mozilla Firefox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Firefox), and [Safari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_\(web_browser\)), some [email clients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_client), standalone [download managers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Download_manager) like [youtube-dl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youtube-dl), other [command-line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line) utilities like [cURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL), and arguably [headless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_software) [services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_\(systems_architecture\)) that power part of a larger application, such as a [web crawler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler).

~ The user agent plays the role of the [client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_\(computing\)) in a [clientâ€“server system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model). The [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP) [User-Agent header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-Agent_header) is intended to clearly identify the agent to the server. However, this header can be omitted or [spoofed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent_spoofing), so some websites use [other agent detection methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_sniffing).
