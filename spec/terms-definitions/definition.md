~ Wikipedia: A definition is a statement of the meaning of a term (a [word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word), [phrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase), or other set of [symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol)). Definitions can be classified into two large categories: [intensional definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensional_definition) (which try to give the sense of a term), and [extensional definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensional_definition) (which try to list the objects that a term describes). Another important category of definitions is the class of [ostensive definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostensive_definition), which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions.
