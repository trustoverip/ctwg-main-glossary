[[def: intermediary-system, intermediary system, intermediary systems, intermediary, intermediaries]]

~ An intermediary system [[ref: routes]] [[ref: messages]] between [[ref: endpoint systems]] but is not otherwise involved in the processing of those [[ref: messages]]. In the context of [[ref: end-to-end encryption]], intermediary systems cannot [[ref: decrypt]] the [[ref: messages]] sent between the [[ref: endpoint systems]]. In the [[ref: ToIP stack]], intermediary systems operate at [[ref: ToIP Layer 2]], the [[ref: trust spanning layer]]. An intermediary system is one of three types of systems defined in the [[ref: ToIP Technology Architecture Specification]]; the other two are [[ref: endpoint systems]] and [[ref: supporting systems]].
