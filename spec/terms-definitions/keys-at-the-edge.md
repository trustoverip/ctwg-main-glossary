[[def: keys-at-the-edge, keys-at-the-edge]]

~ A [[ref: key management]] architecture in which [[ref: keys]] are stored on a user’s local edge devices, such as a smartphone, tablet, or laptop, and then used in conjunction with a secure protocol to unlock a [[ref: key management system]] (KMS) and/or a [[ref: digital vault]] in the cloud. This approach can enable the storage and sharing of large [[ref: data]] structures that are not feasible on edge devices. This architecture can also be used in conjunction with [[ref: confidential computing]] to enable cloud-based [[ref: digital agents]] to safely carry out “user not present” operations.

~ Also known as: [[ref: KATE]].
