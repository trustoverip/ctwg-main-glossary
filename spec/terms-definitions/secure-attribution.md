[[def: secure-attribution, secure attribution]]

~ Secure attribution is strongly related to _making and proving statements_. A [[ref: controller]] makes statements to the a [[ref: validator]] or [[ref: verifier]], who in turn validates the statements issued. A [[ref: controller]] "_owns_" the statement: content and attribution via digital signatures. Secure attribution is "whodunit?!" in cyberspace.
