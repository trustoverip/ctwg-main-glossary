[[def: zero-trust-architecture, zero-trust architecture, zero-trust architectures, ZTA, ZTAs]]

~ A network security architecture based on the core design principle “never trust, always verify”, so that all [[ref: actors]] are denied access to resources pending [[ref: verification]].

~ Also known as: perimeterless security, zero-trust security, [[ref: ZTA]].

~ Contrast with: [[ref: attribute-based access control]], [[ref: role-based access control]].

~ Supporting definitions:

~ [NIST-CSRC](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/zero_trust_architecture): A security model, a set of system design principles, and a coordinated cybersecurity and system management strategy based on an acknowledgement that threats exist both inside and outside traditional network boundaries. The zero trust security model eliminates implicit trust in any one element, component, node, or service and instead requires continuous verification of the operational picture via real-time information from multiple sources to determine access and other system responses.

~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model): The zero trust security model, also known as zero trust architecture (ZTA), and sometimes known as perimeterless security, describes an approach to the strategy, design and implementation of [IT systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_system). The main concept behind the zero trust security model is "never trust, always verify," which means that users and devices should not be trusted by default, even if they are connected to a permissioned network such as a corporate [LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network) and even if they were previously verified.
