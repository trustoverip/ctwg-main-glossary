[[def: hash-function, hash function, hash functions]]

~ An algorithm that computes a numerical value (called the [[ref: hash value]]) on a [[ref: data]] file or electronic [[ref: message]] that is used to represent that file or message, and depends on the entire contents of the file or message. A hash function can be considered to be a fingerprint of the file or message. Approved hash functions satisfy the following properties: _one-way_ (it is computationally infeasible to find any input that maps to any pre-specified output); and _collision resistant_ (it is computationally infeasible to find any two distinct inputs that map to the same output).
